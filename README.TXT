1. Put all related files under a single root directory.
2. Use your student ID and name in PINYING to name your root directory.
3. Make a subdirectory for each exercise, e.g., excercise01/, excercise02/...
4. Under each exercise directory, you may further organize the files into subdirectories, for examples,  e.g., exercise01/src/,  exercise01/bin/,exercise01/results/. 
5. Reuse as many codes as you can between different excercises. Make sure the shared header files and functions are put under subdirectories include/ or shared_src/. We will judge the modularity of your program based on the amount of code shared between different exercises.
