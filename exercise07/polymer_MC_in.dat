# sample L conformers for the polymer with PERM sampling. L is the sample size. 
# calculate thermodynamics properties use the sample set.
# Repeat the calculateion M times. Use respetcive averages and
# standard deviations to estimation ensemble averages and error ranges.   
# Carry out the above calculations for the following sample sizes.
# Observe how the averages and error ranges converge with sample sizes.
